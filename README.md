# SQLProject
Our application is mainly for gyms tracking progress of their customers.
It will focus on tracking exercise, work with trainers, and other health components to help maintain a routine of fitness.
The application will have entities such as progress, customer, trainers, and activity all with their own attributes that specify their necessity and connect to each other to keep the utilization of the application simple and easy to use, yet detailed in its tracking. 
It helps gyms or other fitness companies keep track of renewal rates and compare them to how well customers are achieving their goals.
